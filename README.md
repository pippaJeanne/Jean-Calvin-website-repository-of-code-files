# Jean-Calvin-website-repository-of-code-files
Repository holding the code files and templates I created and used in my website https://lettres-calvin.rarebook-ubfc.fr.

I created a website named John Calvin: French Correspondence as part of my master's thesis for the program Rare Books and Digital Humanities at the Université de Franche-Comté in France, class of 2020-2022.

Here you will find the files of the code I either created or adapted, the transformation sheets and XML-TEI templates I created for the digital critical edition.
